## How to use portfolio
---
The first time the user opens the program the user will be prompted to name their BTC protfolio.
Afterwards the user will get navigation options to visit other features of the program.
Live BTC price is updated every 20 minutes from a google sheet to calculate the current value of the portfolio.
More usevul values can be found in the dashboard section. More trades can be added from the add trade section.
All added trades are added uploaded to the same google sheet. A list of trades can be generated from the trades list section.

- Trades list
    - A List of trades will be generated via the trade class in trade.py
    - The data is collected from the google sheet
        - The list will show:
            - Number of the trade
            - Date bought/sold

### Future features
- Calculate realized profit loss on sold BTC
- Rename portfolio
- Have multiple portfolios
- Support multible currencies
- Password to enter portfolio

## Data Model
---
- I used a class "Trade" in trade.py to generate the list of trades.
- I made two helper funtions: 
    1. Calculate the sum of a cerrtain cell range in the google sheet. 
    2. Valdidate input characters
- Every section runs its own function and all functions end in running the navigation function

## Testing
---
- I have tested this program with the steps below:
    - Passed the code through the (PEP8)[http://pep8online.com/] without any erros
    - Corrected any errors found in the errors list in gitpod
    - manually tested the program and giving invalid errors to see that the correct error message is displayed

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs
- I could not figure out how to compare two lists or strings:
    - FIX: I found a solution here (Adam smith)[https://www.adamsmith.haus/python/answers/how-to-get-the-difference-between-two-list-in-python]
- The program needed to have two trades entered in the list to be abel to make calculations in dashboard
    - FIX: I added some if statements that prevents values to be 0 since you canÂ´t devide something with 0
- I could not get message to show a message that the trades list is empty if no trades has beeen added
    - FIX: The if statemen was previously in a for loop that would iterate the same amount of times as entered trades.
    But since it was empty the loop never started and could not show the else statement. I instead but the for loop in the if statement.

#### Remaining bugs
- It is not really a bug but I uploaded a credentials file to git hub because I forgot to add it to my gitignore file.
I tried librarys bfg and tried git obliterate without it working. CI support advised me to leave it in the histroy and previous gits.
I have deleted and swiched the credentials file since then so no active key saved on github.

### Validator testing
- PEP8
    - No errors found on (PEP8)[http://pep8online.com/]
## Deployment
---
- Steps for deployment:
    - Add \n in the end of to all inputs
    - Write "command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt" to create list in requirements.txt of installed libraries the program needs to run
    - Create account on (Heroku)[https://www.heroku.com/home]
    - Create new app on Heroku and name it
    - Go to settings and add two config vars file:
        - CREDS.json contains all content from my credentials file to be able to access the google sheet
        - PORT 8000 as instructed by CI
    - Add buildpacks in this order:
        - Python
        - Nodejs
    - Go to deploy section:
        - Connect to Github
        - Search for your program on Github
        - Press deploy
